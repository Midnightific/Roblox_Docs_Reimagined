## So what's this for?

This is a community-driven documentation site for Roblox. We're trying to make it easier for developers to find the information they need to make their games and scripts better.
We're also trying to make it easier for new developers to get started with Roblox, and to help them understand the concepts behind the services and functions they're using.

We've got everything from tutorials to in-depth explanations of the services and functions available in Roblox. We're constantly adding new content, so check back often!

We're still in the early stages of development, so there's not much here yet. But we're working on it!


Go check out the [Tutorials](/tutorials) or [Roblox Services Explained](/services) pages to get started!
