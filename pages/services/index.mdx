# Introduction

Welcome! It's great to see you here looking to learn about services.

Services are a way to access a plethora of function that are essential for your game. This is useful for things like database connections, API clients, and more.

## Retrieving a service

To retrieve a service, you can use the following code:

```lua filename="somescript.lua"
  local service = game:GetService("ServiceName")
```

As you can see, it's really easy to retrieve a service! Although not as widely used, these are still valid ways to retrieve a service:

```lua filename="somescript.lua"
  local service = game.ServiceName
  local service = game:WaitForChild("ServiceName")
```

But it's better to use the first method, as it's more reliable and up-to-date.

## List of services

We're still working on this, so please be paitent while we write it!

In the meantime, you can find a full list of services [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes) -> only check out the 'Classes tab' and bear in mind that services
will always end with 'Service'; there are other classes in there so make sure you're looking at the right one!
